### Bugs and feature requests

Please, [search the closed issues](https://github.com/yeriomin/YalpStore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) before creating a bug or a feature request.

Also, please make sure you are using the latest version available through [F-droid](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=com.github.yeriomin.yalpstore).

Keep in mind that naming an issue is important for future searches. Naming it "Bug" or "A request" is unhelpful.

### Translations

Please, check out project's POEditor page:

https://poeditor.com/join/project/LUPUijv2Cs

POEditor is a web service for managing opensource translations. Don't hesitate to try it, you don't have to be technically adept to use it.

### Device definitions

Yalp Store relies on users' crash reports as a source of device definitions for spoofing.

If you have an email client installed on your device, you can click on the developer's email on the Yalp Store About page, and a devce definition file will be attached to your letter.
